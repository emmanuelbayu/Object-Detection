## Hello!

This is my first project related to computer vision, which is object detection. It allows the webcam of our laptop/computer to detect objects.\
\
The tools that we are going to be using are:
* **OpenCV**. It is a great library for computer vision and supports so many programming languages. In this project, we will be using Python's OpenCV. The documentation for the library can be found [here](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html).
* For the **dataset**, we will be using **coco dataset** which can be found [here](https://cocodataset.org/#home).\
\
* This project uses ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-05122A?style=flat&logo=python)
